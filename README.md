# ALD-data-scraping

The purpose of this project is to manual scrape data from papers on atomic layer deposited (ALD) materials.  The scraped data is then made avilable via a google sheet and data can be used to seek new relationships and understanding about ALD growth prcesses and the resulting materials.
